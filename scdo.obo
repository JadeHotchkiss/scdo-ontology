The Glasgow Coma Scale is a system of examining a comatose patient. It is helpful for evaluating the depth of the coma, tracking the patient's progress, and predicting (somewhat) the ultimate outcome of the coma.

Fifteen is the largest possible number of total points, indicating the highest level of functioning. The highest level of functioning would be demonstrated by an individual who spontaneously opens his/her eyes, gives appropriate answers to questions about his/her situation, and can carry out a command (such as \"move your leg\" or \"nod your head\"). Three is the least possible number of total points and would be given to a patient for whom not even a painful stimulus is sufficient to provoke a response.

Response is by circling 'yes' or 'no' to each question. Responses are then summed to give an overall score. For the causal subscale, respondents are asked what they perceive to be the cause of their illness and are asked to respond to each of the listed causes using a 5-point Likert style scale, ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree.

comment: Roughly one-third of affected individuals can predict the onset of a migraine because it is preceded by an "aura," visual disturbances that appear as flashing lights, zig-zag lines or a temporary loss of vision. People with migraine tend to have recurring attacks triggered by a number of different factors, including stress, anxiety, hormonal changes, bright or flashing lights, lack of food or sleep, and dietary substances. Migraine in some women may relate to changes in hormones and hormonal levels during their menstrual cycle. For many years, scientists believed that migraines were linked to the dilation and constriction of blood vessels in the head. Investigators now believe that migraine has a genetic cause.

property_value: SCDO:0000662 "Symptoms depend on which nerve is damaged, and whether the damage affects one nerve, several nerves, or the whole body. Pain and numbness: Tingling or burning in the arms and legs may be an early sign of nerve damage. These feelings often start in your toes and feet. You may have deep pain. This often happens in the feet and legs. You may lose feeling in your legs and arms. Because of this, you may not notice when you step on something sharp. You may not notice when you touch something that is too hot or cold, like the water in a bathtub. You may not know when you have a small blister or sore on your feet. Numbness may make it harder to tell where your feet are moving and can cause a loss of balance. Muscle problems: Damage to the nerves can make it harder to control muscles. It can also cause weakness. You may notice problems moving a part of your body. You may fall because your legs buckle. You may trip over your toes. Doing tasks such as buttoning a shirt may be harder. You may also notice that your muscles twitch or cramp. Your muscles may become smaller. Problems with body organs: People with nerve damage may have problems digesting food. You may feel full or bloated and have heartburn after eating only a little food. Sometimes you may vomit food that has not been digested well. You may have either loose stools or hard stools. Some people have problems swallowing. Damage to the nerves to your heart may cause you to feel light-headed, or faint, when you stand up. Angina is the warning chest pain for heart disease and heart attack. Nerve damage may \"hide\" this warning sign. You should learn other warning signs of a heart attack. They are sudden fatigue, sweating, shortness of breath, nausea, and vomiting." xsd:string

Known causes include the following: Diabetes Mellitus, Excessive use of alcohol, Nutritional deficiencies (such as thiamin deficiency), an uncommon cause in the United States, except among alcoholics who are malnourished, Vitamin B12 deficiency, which causes subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord (see Subacute Combined Degeneration) and often pernicious anemia (see Inadequate absorption), An underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), Toxic substances, including heavy metals such as lead and mercury, Kidney failure, Certain cancers, such as lung cancer, Rarely, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) taken in excessive amounts." xsd:string
property_value: SCDO:0000662 "Acute polyneuropathy (as occurs in Guillain-Barré syndrome) begins suddenly in both legs and progresses rapidly upward to the arms. Symptoms include weakness and a pins-and-needles sensation or loss of sensation. The muscles that control breathing may be affected, resulting in respiratory failure.In the most common form of chronic polyneuropathy, only sensation is affected. Usually, the feet are affected first, but sometimes the hands are. A pins-and-needles sensation, numbness, burning pain, and loss of vibration sense and position sense (knowing where the arms and legs are) are prominent symptoms. Because position sense is lost, walking and even standing become unsteady. Consequently, muscles may not be used. Eventually, they may weaken and waste away. Then, muscles may become stiff and permanently shortened (called contractures). Diabetic neuropathy commonly causes painful tingling or burning sensations in the hands and feet-a condition called distal polyneuropathy. Pain is often worse at night and may be aggravated by touch or by a change in temperature. People may lose the senses of temperature and pain, so they often burn themselves and may have open sores caused by prolonged pressure or other injuries. Without pain as a warning of too much stress, joints are susceptible to injuries. This type of injury is called neurogenic arthropathy (Charcot joints) Polyneuropathy often affects the nerves of the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary functions in the body (such as blood pressure, heart rate, digestion, salivation, and urination). Typical symptoms are constipation, sexual dysfunction, and fluctuating blood pressure-most notably a sudden fall in blood pressure when a person stands up (orthostatic hypotension). The skin may become pale and dry, and sweating may be reduced. Much less often, control of bowel movements or urination is lost, leading to fecal or urinary incontinence." xsd:string

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
comment: The number of QALYs lived by an individual in one year is simply: QALYs lived in one year = 1 * Q with Q <= 1; where Q is the health-related quality of life weight attached to the relevant year of life. I.e. QALY assumes a utility value (quality of life) of 1 = perfect health and a utility value of 0 = dead: Years of Life x Utility Value = Number of QALYs. E.g. If a person lives in perfect health for one year, that person will have 1 QALY (1 Year of Life x 1 Utility Value = 1 QALY), If a person lives in perfect health but only for half a year, that person will have 0.5 QALYs (0.5 Years of Life x 1 Utility Value = 0.5 QALYs) OR if a person lives for 1 year in a situation with 0.5 utility (half of perfect health), that person will also have 0.5 QALYs (1 Year of Life x 0.5 Utility Value = 0.5 QALYs). In cost-effectiveness evaluations the QALY is used to quantify the effectiveness of, for instance, a new medication versus the current one. In other words, the current standard of care is taken as the baseline, and the QALYs gained from the new (improved) intervention are counted in addition.

comment: In the protocol provided, albumin concentration is measured according to a fluorescent immunoassay (FIA). The protocol also lists reference ranges for healthy adults.\n\nThe criteria for clinically significant proteinuria have been changed from an albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 30 mg/mmol or more to 3 mg/mmol or more. This is because there is evidence that the risk of adverse outcomes is a continuum and starts at an ACR well below 30 mg/mmol.\n\nThe Sickle Cell Disease Research and Scientific Panel notes that the terms "microalbuminuria" and "macroalbuminuria" have been used clinically to describe different levels of abnormal albumin excretion rate: 30-299 mg/g urine creatinine, and >300 mg/gr urine creatinine, for microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria, respectively. Recently, a new terminology has been proposed: "low level albuminuria" instead of microalbuminuia, and "high level albuminuria" for macroalbuminuria, since the older terminology could be interpreted as measuring different molecular forms of albumin. \n\nBecause albuminuria may be affected by non-pathological factors (exercise, menstruation contamination, biological variability, etc.), abnormal values should be confirmed within 1-2 months.

comment: Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a potentially life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia that presents as a wide QRS complex tachycardia, and is defined as three or more consecutive QRS complexes with a duration longer than 120 milliseconds (ms) and a rate of 100 beats per minute or more, whereby the complexes have a ventricular origin. VT can be subdivided as follows: (i) sustained VT persists for 30 seconds or more; (ii) non-sustained VT lasts less than 30 seconds; (iii) monomorphic VT displays a uniform QRS morphology; and (iv) polymorphic VT displays QRS morphologies that variy from beat to beat. VT is observed most commonly in individuals with structural heart disease or acute myocardial infarction (MI). VT may also be observed in in the setting of drug toxicity or electrolyte abnormalities or in individuals with Mendelian disease.

comment: Myocarditis can be caused by a variety of bacterial and viral infections. Enteroviruses, especially coxsackievirus B, are often associated with acute myocarditis. However, with the advent of genetic analysis, adenovirus and parvovirus B19 have also been found to be frequent causes of myocarditis. Exposure to drug treatment, physical stimuli such as radiation and heat, metabolic disorders, immune disorders, and pregnancy are also causes of myocarditis. Many cases of myocarditis are idiopathic. Myocarditis presents with non-specific symptoms including chest pain, dyspnoea, and palpitations, and thus often mimics more common disorders such as coronary artery disease. In some patients, cardiac MRI and endomyocardial biopsy can help identify myocarditis, predict risk of cardiovascular events, and guide treatment.

comment: NATS can detect HIV infection about 7 to 28 days after a person has been infected with HIV.\nNATs are very expensive and not routinely used for HIV screening unless the person had a high-risk exposure or a possible exposure with early symptoms of HIV infection.

comment: Often these individuals have co-inherited another hemoglobin mutation that decreases hemoglobin solubility (eg, HbS-Antilles; Hb-Quebec-Chori; HbS-Oman; Hb Jamaica Plain).\n\nOther rare causes of symptomatic sickle cell trait include: mosaicism for cells in which only the sickle mutation was expressed due to post-zygotic uniparental disomy, and when sickle cell trait coexists with pyruvate kinase deficiency, which lowers the hemoglobin oxygen affinity, resulting in hemoglobin S polymerization and sickling.

comment: If a person tests “positive,” then further testing is needed to determine if this is a new “acute” infection or a “chronic” hepatitis B infection. \n\nA positive HBsAg test result means that you are infected and can spread the hepatitis B virus to others through your blood.

comment: A "positive" or "reactive" anti-HBc (or HBcAb) test result indicates a past or current hepatitis B infection. \n\nThe core antibody does not provide any protection against the hepatitis B virus (unlike the surface antibod). This test can only be fully understood by knowing the results of the HBsAg and anti-HBs tests.\n\nA positive anti-HBc (or HBcAb) test result requires talking to your health care provider for a complete explanation of your hepatitis B status.
