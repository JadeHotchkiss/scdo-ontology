SCDO:0001388	Haemoglobin Bart Hydrops Fetalis	Alpha Thalassemia	Normal adult haemoglobin is composed of two chains each of alpha and beta globin. Hb Barts (haemoglobin Barts) is a tetramer with four gamma globin chains, and is essentially pathognomonic for one or another form of alpha thalassemia. Hb Barts has an extremely high affinity for oxygen, resulting in almost no oxygen delivery to the tissues.	absence of alpha globin synthesis with gamma globin synthesis	homozygous deletion of hba1 and hba2	HBA1		http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005507	HP:0005507	Hb Bart is normally not present in adult blood. It makes up about 85-90 percent of haemoglobin in Hb Bart hydrops fetalis syndrome, and about 2-5 percent in HbH disease.	The description should include the type of mutation, and the gene in which the mutation is found i.e. deletion of all four alpha-globin encoding genes (HBA1 and HBA2). The description explains the tetramer, but not the syndrome. RECOMMEND: Rename as homozygous alpha-thalassemia (recommend that add this to disease ontology). Make clear in description that it is the homozygous deletion of HBA1 and HBA2.	fatal hydrops fetalis	Haemoglobin barts disease is an alpha-thalassemia that is a caused by an abnormal phenotype where the alpha globin synthesis is absent and there is an increase in the gamma globin syntheses. This phenotypes is caused by a homozygous deletion mutation of the hba1 and hba2 gene. This leads to a haemoglobin molecule with four gamma globin parts and lacks an alpha globin.
