SCDO:0000518	Haemoglobin Bart Hydrops Fetalis	absence of alpha globin synthesis with gamma globin synthesis	homozygous deletion of hba1 and hba2	HBA1		fatal hydrops fetalis	Haemoglobin barts disease is an alpha-thalassemia that is a caused by an abnormal phenotype where the alpha globin synthesis is absent and there is an increase in the gamma globin syntheses. This phenotypes is caused by a homozygous deletion mutation of the hba1 and hba2 gene. This leads to a haemoglobin molecule with four gamma globin parts and lacks an alpha globin.
