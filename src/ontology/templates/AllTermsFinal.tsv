The Glasgow Coma Scale is a system of examining a comatose patient. It is helpful for evaluating the depth of the coma, tracking the patient's progress, and predicting (somewhat) the ultimate outcome of the coma. The Glasgow Coma Scale assigns a different number of points for exam results in three different categories: opening the eyes, verbal response (using words or voice to respond), and motor response (moving a part of the body). Fifteen is the largest possible number of total points, indicating the highest level of functioning. The highest level of functioning would be demonstrated by an individual who spontaneously opens his/her eyes, gives appropriate answers to questions about his/her situation, and can carry out a command (such as ""move your leg"" or ""nod your head""). Three is the least possible number of total points and would be given to a patient for whom not even a painful stimulus is sufficient to provoke a response. In the middle are those patients who may be able to respond, but who require an intense or painful stimulus, and whose response may demonstrate some degree of brain malfunctioning (such as a person whose only response to pain in a limb is to bend that limb in toward the body). When performed as part of the admission examination, a Glasgow score of three to five points often suggests that the patient has likely suffered fatal brain damage, while eight or more points indicates that the patient's chances for recovery are good. Expansion of the pupils and respiratory pattern are also important. Metabolic causes of coma are diagnosed from blood work and urinalysis to evaluate blood chemistry, drug screen, and blood cell abnormalities that may indicate infection. Anatomic causes of coma are diagnosed from CT (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans."	Comas

The basic formula for YLL (without yet including other social preferences discussed below), is the following for a given cause, age and sex: YLL = N x L where: N = number of deaths L = standard life expectancy at age of death in years. Because YLL measure the incident stream of lost years of life due to deaths, an incidence perspective has also been taken for the calculation of YLD in the original Global Burden of Disease Study for year 1990 and in subsequent WHO updates for years 2000 to 2004. To estimate YLD for a particular cause in a particular time period, the number of incident cases in that period is multiplied by the average duration of the disease and a weight factor that reflects the severity of the disease on a scale from 0 (perfect health) to 1 (dead). The basic formula for YLD is the following (again, without applying social preferences): YLD = I x DW x L where: I = number of incident cases; DW = disability weight; L = average duration of the case until remission or death (years). Prevalence YLD - The recent GBD 2010 study published by IHME in December 2012 used an updated life expectancy standard for the calculation of YLL and based the YLD calculation on prevalence rather than incidence: YLD = P x DW where: P = number of prevalent cases; DW = disability weight.

SCDO:0000611	Illness Perception Questionnaire Revised (IPQ-R)	"The IPQ-R is an 84-item self-completed instrument developed to provide a quantitative measurement of the components of illness representations, as described by Leventhal's Common-Sense Model (CSM) of selfregulation it is divided into 3 sections: identity subscale (14 symptoms), causal subscale (18 causes), and a third section which contains 7 subscales, including consequences, timeline acute/chronic and cyclical, personal and treatment control/cure, illness coherence, and emotional representations. The questionnaire wording can be adapted to the specific illness by replacing the word illness with the name of the condition. For the identity subscale, respondents are asked if they have experienced a number of symptoms since their illness, and if they feel the symptoms are related to their current illness. Response is by circling 'yes' or 'no' to each question. Responses are then summed to give an overall score. For the causal subscale, respondents are asked what they perceive to be the cause of their illness and are asked to respond to each of the listed causes using a 5-point Likert style scale, ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Respondents are also asked to rank the 3 most important factors believed to be the cause of their illness. The third section (7 subscales) is scored by summing responses to each item is on a 5-point Likert style scale, ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. All items for each of the subscales are summed to give an overall score. High scores on the identity, consequences, timeline acute/chronic and cyclical subscales represent strongly held beliefs about the number of symptoms attributed, the negative consequences, and the chronicity and cyclical nature of the illness. High scores on the personal and treatment control and coherence subscales represent positive beliefs about controllability and a personal understanding of the illness.

If a person lives in perfect health for one year, that person will have 1 QALY (1 Year of Life x 1 Utility Value = 1 QALY), If a person lives in perfect health but only for half a year, that person will have 0.5 QALYs (0.5 Years of Life x 1 Utility Value = 0.5 QALYs) OR if a person lives for 1 year in a situation with 0.5 utility (half of perfect health), that person will also have 0.5 QALYs (1 Year of Life x 0.5 Utility Value = 0.5 QALYs). In cost-effectiveness evaluations the QALY is used to quantify the effectiveness of, for instance, a new medication versus the current one.

SCDO:0004623	Codon	Also known as sense codon, a set of three nucleotides in a protein coding sequence that specifies individual amino acids or a termination signal (Codon, Terminator). Most codons are universal, but some organisms do not produce the transfer RNAs (RNA, Transfer) complementary to all codons. These codons are referred to as unassigned codons (nonsense codons).

SCDO:0004716	Codon initiation	A codon that directs initiation of protein translation (Translation, Genetic) by stimulating the binding of initiator tRNA (RNA, TRANSFER, MET). In prokaryotes, the codons AUG or GUG can act as initiators while in eukaryotes, AUG is the only initiator codon.	"http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/MESH/D018387"				
SCDO:0001626	Nonsense codon	An amino acid-specifying codon that has been converted to a stop codon (Codon terminator) by mutation.

SCDO:0001158	Indel mutation	Also known as insertion-deletion mutation, a mutation named with the blend of insertion and deletion. It refers to a length difference between two alleles where it is unknowable if the difference was originally caused by a sequence insertion or by a sequence deletion. If the number of nucleotides in the insertion/deletion is not divisible by three, and it occurs in a protein coding region, it is also a frameshift mutation.	"http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/MESH/D054643"				
SCDO:0001388	insertion	Insertion mutation is the mutation caused by the introduction of foreign DNA sequences into a gene or extragenic sequence. This may occur spontaneously in vivo or be experimentally induced in vivo or in vitro. Proviral DNA insertions into or adjacent to a cellular proto-oncogene can interrupt genetic translation of the coding sequences or interfere with recognition of regulatory elements and cause unregulated expression of the proto-oncogene resulting in tumor formation.	http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/MESH/D016254
